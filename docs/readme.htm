<h1 align="center">About UltraStats</h1>
</div>
<p>Somebody really reads this document, hurra :D! So you proberly want to know
more about UltraStats ;)!</p>
<p>There have been some beta releases in 2006, and a little bit silence since
that. Now with Call of Duty 4 the interests in making stats for this franchise
returned to me, and so here it is. The first BETA Version of UltraStats which
supports Call of Duty 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE</b></font>, do not expect Final 
Release quality! I expect that there are still bugs in the UltraStats! If you 
found a bug, please check the <b>known Issues</b> section before you post a new 
thread into our
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.shooter-szene.de/PNphpBB2-index-c-25.phtml">
Forums</a> ;)!</p>
<h2>What is UltraStats? </h2>
<p>UltraStats is a stats parser and web front-end for Call of Duty (+UO), Call
of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4.</p>
<h2>What features are supported yet?</h2>
<p>Currently there is already a bunch of features available, for details see 
List below: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Main Overview with Top Played Rounds, Top Players, Serverlist and 
	Medallist</li>
	<li>Total Statistics and per Server statistics, so you can either view 
	statistics for all servers consolidated, or only for a Server. </li>
	<li>Round based Stats, this means each played round is recorded and can be 
	viewed in a large list. It is also possible to filter the rounds by gametype</li>
	<li>Round Details, for each round you will be able to view details like 
	Kills Deaths, a chatlog and round ration per player. </li>
	<li>Player Search, you can search either by Ingame-GUID or PlayerAlias</li>
	<li>Player Stats, lists players by different criteria's like most kills or 
	deaths. </li>
	<li>Player Details, which is available for each player. Many things like 
	Favorite Weapon and Map are displayed, a hit location model where the player 
	hit others and were hit. </li>
	<li>Weapon Stats, display details about the weapons and the Top Killer's and 
	Top Killed By. If you filter by server, you will only see the weapons that 
	have been used on the server.</li>
	<li>Server Stats, shows the maps played on the Server, sorted by PlayCount. 
	For each map you can also browse through the last played rounds. </li>
	<li>Admin Center, gives you the possibility to fully administrate 
	UltraStats. You can edit players, add / edit servers, download and parse 
	logfiles, or clean up the database.</li>
	<li>Ban Players, if you think someone cheats you can simple ban him in the 
	Player editor. He will be totally hidden in the stats, but the data remains 
	intact. You can also delete him if you want to totally get rid if him ;)!</li>
	<li>MultiLanguage, by default there is english and german, but other 
	languages are easily possible. Contact us if you are interested in 
	translation UltraStats into your foreign language!</li>
	<li>Time Logging, a little bit experimential as it is a mix of the file 
	creation date of the logfile, and the time entries in the logfile, which 
	start from 0 everytime the server is restarted. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What features are planned for the future? </h2>
<p>My todo list grows every day, but here is a list of most important things 
this will be added till the final release: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Admin Center: Weapon Editor, so you can edit the weapon details. </li>
	<li>Admin Center: String Editor, so you can edit map, weapon and others 
	texts in the database. </li>
	<li>Admin Center: Player Editor, additional fields will be available like 
	adding a picture and description for players. Typically you would do this 
	for Clan members. </li>
	<li>Admin Center: User Access Level, which means you will be able to define 
	different access levels for users. Useful for GameServer ISP's who do not 
	want the Clans to have full control on the stats. </li>
	<li>Clanfilter: You can already set a flag to specify who is a Clanmember 
	and who is not. In the final version, you will be able to only display Stats 
	for Clan members. </li>
	<li>ServerStats: Add LiveView, so you can see who is actually playing on the 
	Server. </li>
	<li>RoundStats: Calcute Rounds Results based on Actions, for better detailed 
	results. </li>
	<li>SkillValue: Will be added, so you have an additional value which will be 
	a configurable value from Kills, Deaths, GameActions and so on. </li>
	<li>Add Menu into Language System, hasn't been done yet. </li>
	<li>Add more map and weapon description, also in german language!</li>
	<li>lots of other stuff which I can't remember at the moment ;)</li>
	<li>Time Filter, Year and month. The database already logs Year and month 
	data, with the final, it will be possible to filter the statistics by Year 
	and even by Month. A very nice feature for monthly stats without deleting 
	the database. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>There are some problems I am aware of, but haven't got the time to really fix 
them. You will find a list below: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Time Calculation is <b><font color="#FF0000"> not accurate</font></b> yet, for some reason the time runs 
	forward. I will have to rewrite the time calc coding in order to fix
      this.&nbsp; </li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Important Notices! </h2>
<p>There are things you have to take care when you use UltraStats. </p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MultiServer</b> - If you are using more then one Server in your 
	UltraStats Installation, make sure that your game server is using DIFFERENT 
	game log files! During development, I had the case where one log file 
	contained the data of two servers. The log file was totally garbage and did 
	not produce any useful results!</li>
</ul>
