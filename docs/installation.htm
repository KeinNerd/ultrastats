<h1 align="center">Installing UltraStats</h1>
</div>
<p>Welcome to my quick and dirty install documentation. It is quick and dirty 
because it is 0:00 am now and I am very tired, but it needs to be done ;) Please 
keep in mind that this is still <font color="#FF0000"><b>BETA SOFTWARE</b></font>! 
This release is intended for testing only, I expect still many bugs hidden 
somewhere in the stats.</p>
<blockquote>
	<h2>Step 1 - Check prerequisites</h2>
	<p>Before you start installing UltraStats, you should should make sure that you 
have the following: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Apache Webserver 1.3 or 2.0</b> or higher (Ask your Webserver ISP if you are 
	not sure)</li>
		<li><b>PHP 4.x or PHP 5.x</b> or higher is installed, UltraStats has been tested 
	with both successfully.</li>
		<li><b>MySQL Database</b> (4.x or 5.x or higher)! Optional, I recommend that you 
	have PhpMyAdmin installed. You may will need it for testing and debugging. 
	However the installation can be done WITHOUT PhpMyAdmin!</li>
		<li>About <b>20MB</b> of free <b>Webspace</b> and at least <b>10MB</b> of database space. You 
	will need more database space if your logfile grows. However UltraStats has 
	a high optimized database layout. </li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Step 2 - Run the Installation Script</h2>
	<p>I made it as easy as I could, you simple need to unpack the UltraStats 
archive and upload it onto your Webserver. After you have done this, kindly open
	<a href="http://www.yourwebhost.com/ultrastats/install.php">http://www.yourwebhost.com/ultrastats/install.php</a> and follow the 
installation instructions. A few files and directories need write access, the 
installer will tell you which files. </p>
	<h2>Step 3 - Add your first Server</h2>
	<p>If everything goes right, you should have your UltraStats Installation 
running in 5-10 minutes. You can now proceed to the Admin Center, login and add 
your first Server. Important is that you configure the correct Gamelog location. 
This is a relative path on the Webserver.</p>
	<p>I recommend to use something like this: 
	<div class="with_border"><b>../gamelogs/games-server1.log</b></div>
	<p>If you add the server, the script will try to create an empty file ( if not 
already there ). If this fails, you will receive an error and the server will 
not be added (until the path is correct and the file writeable and readable). 
	</p>
	<p>You can also configure a Remote FTP Path which can be used to automatically 
download the Gamelog from the Webserver. <br>Use a remote ftp path like this:
	<div class="with_border"><b><a href="ftp://username@127.0.0.1/.callofduty2/main/Server1_mp.log">ftp://username@127.0.0.1/.callofduty2/main/Server1_mp.log</a></b></div>
    *Experimental Support for SCP has also been added! Kindly use scp;// instead
    of ftp:// in the FTP Path parameter. But be warned, you will need the SSH2
    Extension for PHP5 installed which itself is still beta and not easy to
    install! For more see the package website of ssh2 for php: <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2">http://pecl.php.net/package/ssh2</a>&nbsp;
	<h2>
    Step 4 - Download the Logfile</h2>
	<p>This step assumes that you have configured a valid FTP Remote path. In order 
to download the logfile click on the
	<img src="../images/icons/download.png" width="16" border="1"> 
icon. If the password is not within the ftp remote path, you will be prompted 
for it automatically. Then the Gamelogfile is downloaded, assuming the path is 
correct. The download script only downloads new stuff from the logfile, this 
means it appends the log. This saves a lot of bandwidth and time if you are 
going to configure updates by hour. </p>
	<h2>Step 5 - Run the Parser</h2>
	<p>Now comes the parser part, also very easy - you just need to click the 
	<img src="../images/icons//gears_run.png" width="16" border="1"> 
icon, and the parser will start. The script is designed to run max. 60 seconds. 
An internal timer will abort processing after 50 seconds, and auto reloads 
itself and resumes from the last position. The parser process will take a lot of 
performance from your Webserver, specially the MySQL server. This is due the 
many Insert statements. In the final version, I might be able to use bulk insert 
to speed the process up. 
</p>
	<h2>Step 6 - Run Total/Final Calculations</h2>
	<p>A very important step! For optimal performance, I have added some helper 
tables to store top aliases. You will see this in the page generation time. Even 
with large databases, the page generation will be very fast compared to other 
stats applications. The step is so important because without, you will not see 
any aliases on the main page!</p>
	<h2>Finished</h2>
	<p>Yes you are done :) Well not really, I think you need to experience all the 
features UltraStats brings to you. Server Admin, Player Editor and User Admin 
are currently working More administrative facilities will come in the final, I 
have planned to add a Map Admin and such stuff.
